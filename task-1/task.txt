Part I
Install Git on your machine. Ensure it works by executing some simple commands according to the provided tutorial.

Create a repository on Github, add a README.md with the name of the repository, date of creation and author. You can add other information or just sample text as well. In the README, use markdown formatting to add the following:
1. At least two header types
2. An image
3. A block of random code (it does not matter which language or what it does, it can even be pseudo code)

Part II
In the created repository, make two additional branches – one titled with your name, and another titled with your favorite color. For the first one, do the following: download your choice of IDE and initialize an empty sample Java/Kotlin project in the repository, in a folder. Afterwards, push your new change out to your remote repository branch. The new empty project should show up in your “name” branch. In the “color” branch, add a text file containing a link to your favorite song (find it on YouTube). Merge the second branch into your master branch. The end result should be that you have two branches, the master and the “name” branch, but we are still able to see the merging and the “color” branch in your commit history.
